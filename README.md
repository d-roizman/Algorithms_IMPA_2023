# Algorithms

This repository contains a few of the algorithms discussed during Luiz Henrique Figueiredo's course ["Algoritmos"](https://lhf.impa.br/cursos/algo/trabalhos.html), at IMPA (Institute of pure and applied mathematics - free translation), during fall 2023. 

Each folder has an algorithm (written in python) related to some of the problems discussed, along with some adjoint files and images. Most are computational geometric or graph algorithms.

Enjoy!
